*************

The libavcodec library provides a generic encoding/decoding framework
and contains multiple decoders and encoders for audio, video and
subtitle streams, and several bitstream filters.

   The shared architecture provides various services ranging from bit
stream I/O to DSP optimizations, and makes it suitable for implementing
robust and fast codecs as well as for experimentation.
